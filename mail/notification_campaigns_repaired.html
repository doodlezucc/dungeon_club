									You might have noticed some oddities in the list of campaigns when logging into your <b>Dungeon Club</b>
									account these last few weeks.

									This mail is to inform you that all campaigns which unexpectedly disappeared are now back.
									Campains which might have been showing up despite being deleted should also be repaired.

									Specifically, here's the list of restorations made to your account:

								<td>
									<b>Some details on what happened:</b><br>
									An unhandled error in the server code caused the
									periodic auto-save to stop auto-saving the account database. The same
									database is also used to store campaign ownership.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="padding: 16px 0;">
									At the start of May, the server was forcefully shut down and restarted by what seems to have
									been a denial of service attack. Due to the last backup dating back to March 6th,
									all <b>account related</b> changes between the auto-save and the shutdown had been undone.
									To be clear, this "memory gap" did not revert the actual contents of any campaign, only their
									individual assigned owners.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									By running a bunch of simulations on the pseudonymized server logs and by making a few
									educated guesses, relationships between accounts and created campaigns affected by the memory gap
									could eventually be established and were restored in the database.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="padding: 16px 0 0 0;">
									If you find any campaigns still missing from your account, please don't hesitate to reach out by replying to this
									email or joining the community Discord server.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="padding: 24px 0 0 0;">
									Sorry for any inconveniences the bug might have caused.
									<br>
									Have a nice day :)
