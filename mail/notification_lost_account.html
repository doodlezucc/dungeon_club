									It's no big hassle, really: to regain access to your account and campaigns,

									<b>Some details on what happened:</b><br>
									An unhandled error in the server code caused the
									periodic auto-save to stop auto-saving the account database. The same
									database is also used to store campaign ownership.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Early in the morning today, the server had apparently shut down unexpectedly. Due to the last backup dating back to October 22nd,
									all <b>account related</b> changes between the auto-save and the shutdown had been undone.
									To be clear, this "memory gap" did not revert the actual contents of any campaign, only their
									individual assigned owners.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td style="padding: 16px 0;">
									By running a bunch of simulations on the pseudonymized server logs and by making a few
									educated guesses, relationships between accounts and created campaigns affected by the memory gap
									could eventually be established and were restored in the database.

									Sorry for any inconveniences the bug might have caused.
